Portfolio

Thought Process and Approach:


1. I researched about portfolio websites and minimalistic designs for the same and implemented this task taking inspiration from suitable designs.

2. Screen recorded the functionalities of my projects which I then added to respective projects on the portfolio website.

3. Implemented a simple structure for the website using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
